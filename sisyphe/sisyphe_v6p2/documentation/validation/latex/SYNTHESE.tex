\estel is a finite element software devoted to underground water flow and pollutant transport. Two modules are enclosed in \estel \rel:
\begin{list}{-}{}
\item[-] \textbf{Flow module} : solves the 3D \textit{Richards} equation in variably saturated and heterogeneous porous media;
\item[-] \textbf{Transport module} : solves the 3D \textit{transport} equation, including simplified geochemical reactions such as retardation, radioactive decay and decay chain.
Sorption isotherm with equilibirium and non-equilibrium can also be handled by \estel.

\end{list}

The present document validates the \estel \rel conceptual model (including both hydraulic and transport modules), algorithmic and software implementations against a large number of test cases. These test cases have been selected for their increasing complexity, going from analytical solution to real in-situ experiments.\\\\
% 
The information in this document refers to the version \rel of \estel, released in June 2010.\\\\
