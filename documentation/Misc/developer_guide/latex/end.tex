\chapter{Information to give when your development is over}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This section will give a list of all the information you need to give to the
person in charge of the integration of your development.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item CUE ticket number.
\item Name of the branch the work is done on.
\item Revision range of work I.e. The revision number of when you started your
development and when it ended on your SVN branch.
\item A list of the file impacted by the development (See \ref{diff} on how to
create that list).
\item The name of the test cases validating the development (\ref{testcase} on how to add a new test case).
\end{itemize}

All those information should be written in the CUE ticket as well.
