 The TELEMAC-2D software is able to generate the appropriate files necessary to run a DELWAQ simulation. This generation is managed by the following keywords:



 \textit{BOTTOM SURFACES DELWAQ FILE}

 \textit{DELWAQ PRINTOUT PERIOD}

 \textit{DELWAQ STEERING FILE}

 \textit{DIFFUSIVITY DELWAQ FILE}

 \textit{DIFFUSIVITY FOR DELWAQ}

 \textit{EXCHANGE AREAS DELWAQ FILE}

 \textit{EXCHANGE BETWEEN NODES DELWAQ FILE}

 \textit{NODES DISTANCES DELWAQ FILE}

 \textit{SALINITY DELWAQ FILE}

 \textit{SALINITY FOR DELWAQ}

 \textit{TEMPERATURE DELWAQ FILE}

 \textit{TEMPERATURE FOR DELWAQ}

 \textit{VELOCITY DELWAQ FILE}

 \textit{VELOCITY FOR DELWAQ}

 More information about these keywords can be found in the TELEMAC-2D reference manual. For more information, please refer to the DELWAQ user documentation.
