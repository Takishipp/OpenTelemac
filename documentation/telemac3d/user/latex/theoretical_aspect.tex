\section{Notations}

tELEMAC-3D is a three-dimensional computational code describing the 3D
velocity field (\textit{U}, \textit{V}, \textit{W}) and the water depth
\textit{h} (and, from the bottom depth, the free surface \textit{S}) at each
time step. Besides, it solves the transport of several tracers which can be
grouped into two categories, namely the so-called ``active'' tracers (primarily
temperature and salinity\footnote{ Sediment transport with \telemac{3D} is not
described in this manual.}), which change the water density and act on flow
through gravity), and the so-called ``passive'' tracers which do not affect the
flow and are merely transported.

\section{Equations}

the reader will refer to the J.-M. Hervouet's book [1] for a detailed statement
of the theoretical aspects which \telemac{3D} is based on.

\subsection{Equation with the hydrostatic pressure hypothesis}

in its basic release, the code solves the three-dimensional hydrodynamic
equations with the following assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
\item three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with a free surface changing
in time,
\item negligible variation of density in the conservation of mass equation
(incompressible fluid),
\item hydrostatic pressure hypothesis (that hypothesis results in that the
pressure at a given depth is the sum of the air pressure at the fluid surface
plus the weight of the overlying water body),
\item Boussinesq approximation for the momentum (the density variations are
only taken into account as buoyant forces),
\end{itemize}

Due to these assumptions, the three-dimensional equations being solved are:

\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:equa1}
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial U}{\partial x} +\frac{\partial V}{\partial y} +\frac{\partial
W}{\partial z} =0
\\
\frac{\partial U}{\partial t} +U\frac{\partial
U}{\partial x} +V\frac{\partial U}{\partial y} +W\frac{\partial U}{\partial z}
=-g\frac{\partial Z_{S} }{\partial x} +\upsilon \; \Delta \left(U\right)+F_{x}
\\
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} +U\frac{\partial V}{\partial
x} +V\frac{\partial V}{\partial y} +W\frac{\partial V}{\partial z}
=-g\frac{\partial Z_{S} }{\partial y} +\upsilon \; \Delta \left(V\right)+F_{y}
\\
p=p_{atm} +\rho _{0} g\left(Z_{s} -z\right)+\rho _{0} g\int _{z}^{Z_{S}
}\frac{\Delta \rho }{\rho _{0} } dz
\\
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
+U\frac{\partial T}{\partial x} +V\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}
+W\frac{\partial T}{\partial z} =\upsilon \; \Delta \left(T\right)+Q
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

wherein:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{h} (m) water depth,

\item \textit{Z${}_{S}$} (m) free surface elevation,

\item \textit{U}, \textit{V}, \textit{W} (m/s) three-dimensional components of
velocity,

\item \textit{T} (${}^\circ$C, g/L\dots ) passive or active (acting on density)
tracer,

\item \textit{p} (X) pressure,

\item \textit{p${}_{atm}$} (X) atmospheric pressure,

\item \textit{g} (m/s2) acceleration due to gravity,

\item $\upsilon$ (m2/s) velocity and tracer diffusion coefficients,

\item \textit{Zf} (m) bottom depth,

\item \textit{r0} (X) reference density,

\item \textit{Dr} (X) variation of density around the reference density,

\item \textit{t} (s) time,

\item \textit{x}, \textit{y} (m) horizontal space components,

\item \textit{z} (m) vertical space component,

\item \textit{F${}_{x}$}, \textit{F${}_{y}$} (m/s2) source terms,

\item \textit{Q} (tracer unit) tracer source of sink.

\item \textit{h}, \textit{U}, \textit{V}, \textit{W} and \textit{T} are the unknown
quantities, also known as computational variables.

\item \textit{F${}_{x}$} and \textit{F${}_{y}$} are source terms denoting the wind,
the Coriolis force and the bottom friction (or any other process being modelled
by similar formulas). Several tracers can be taken into account simultaneously.
They can be of two different kinds, either active, i.e. influencing the flow by
changing the density, or passive, without any effect on density and then on
flow.
\end{itemize}

The \telemac{3D} basic algorithm can be split up in three computational steps
(three fractional steps).

The first step consists in finding out the advected velocity components by
only solving the advection terms in the momentum equations.

The second step computes, from the advected velocities, the new velocity
components taking into account the diffusion terms and the source terms in the
momentum equations. These two solutions enable to obtain an intermediate
velocity field.

The third step is provided for computing the water depth from the vertical
integration of the continuity equation and the momentum equations only
including the pressure-continuity terms (all the other terms have already been
taken into account in the earlier two steps). The resulting two-dimensional
equations (analogous to the Saint-Venant equations without diffusion, advection
and source terms) are written as:

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} +\frac{\partial \left(uh\right)}{\partial x}
+\frac{\partial \left(vh\right)}{\partial y} =0
\\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} =-g\frac{\partial Z_{S} }{\partial x}
\\
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} =-g\frac{\partial Z_{S} }{\partial y}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

The \textit{u} and \textit{v} in lower case denote the two-dimensional
variables of the vertically integrated velocity.

These two-dimensional equations are solved by the libraries in the \telemac{2D}
code and enable to obtain the vertically averaged velocity and the water depth.

The water depth makes it possible to recompute the elevations of the various
mesh points and then those of the free surface.

Lastly, the computation of the \textit{U} and \textit{V} velocities is simply achieved
through a combination of the equations linking the velocities. Finally, the
vertical velocity \textit{W} is computed from the continuity equation.

\subsection{Non-hydrostatic navier-stokes equations}

the following system (with an equation for \textit{W} which is similar to those
for \textit{U} and \textit{V} is then to be solved:

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial U}{\partial x} +\frac{\partial V}{\partial
y} +\frac{\partial W}{\partial z} = 0
\\
\frac{\partial U}{\partial t}
+U\frac{\partial U}{\partial x} +V\frac{\partial U}{\partial y}
+W\frac{\partial U}{\partial z} =-\frac{1}{\rho } \frac{\partial p}{\partial x}
+\upsilon \; \Delta \left(U\right)+F_{x}
\\
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}
+U\frac{\partial V}{\partial x} +V\frac{\partial V}{\partial y}
+W\frac{\partial V}{\partial z} =-\frac{1}{\rho } \frac{\partial p}{\partial y}
+\upsilon \; \Delta \left(V\right)+F_{y}
\\
\frac{\partial W}{\partial t}
+U\frac{\partial W}{\partial x} +V\frac{\partial W}{\partial y}
+W\frac{\partial W}{\partial z} =-\frac{1}{\rho } \frac{\partial p}{\partial z}
-g+\upsilon \; \Delta \left(W\right)+F_{z}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

In order to share a common core as much as possible with the solution of the
equations with the hydrostatic pressure hypothesis, the pressure is split up
into a hydrostatic pressure and a "dynamic" pressure term.
\begin{align}
p=p_{atm} +\rho _{0} g\left(Z_{S} -z\right)+\rho _{0} g\int _{z}^{Z_{S}
}\frac{\Delta \rho }{\rho _{0} } dz +p_{d}
\end{align}
The \telemac{3D} algorithm solves a hydrostatic step which is the same as in the
previous subsection, the only differences lying in the continuity step
("projection" step in which the dynamic pressure gradient changes the velocity
field in order to provide the required zero divergence of velocity) and the
computation of the free surface.

\subsection{The law of state}

two laws of state can be used by default through \telemac{3D}

In most of the simulations, salinity and temperature make it possible to
compute the variations of density. The first law expresses the variation of
density from only these two parameters. The second law is more general and
enables to construct all the variations of density with the active tracers
being taken into account in the computation.

The \textbf{first law} is written as:

\begin{align}
\rho =\rho _{ref} \left[1-\left(T\left(T-T_{ref)} \right)^{2} -750S\right)10^{-6} \right]
\end{align}
With $T_{ref} $ as a reference temperature of 4${}^\circ$C and $\rho _{ref} $
as a reference density at that temperature when the salinity \textit{S} is
zero, then $\rho _{ref} $ = 999.972~kg/m${}^{3}$. That law remains valid for
0${}^\circ$C $<$ \textit{T} $<$ 40${}^\circ$C and 0~g/L $<$ \textit{S} $<$
42~g/L.

The \textbf{second law} is written as:

\begin{align}
\rho =\rho _{ref} \left[1-\sum _{i}\beta _{i} \left(T_{i} -T_{i}^{0} \right)_{i}  \right]
\end{align}
$\rho _{ref}$,
the reference density can be modified by the user together with the volumetric
expansion coefficients $\beta _{i}$ related to the tracers $T_{i}$.

\subsection{k-$\epsilon$ model}

the turbulent viscosity can be given by the user, as determined either from a
mixing length model or from a \textit{k}-e model the equations of which are:

%TODO: See hox to handle that equation (too long and conisdered as two equations)
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial k}{\partial t}
 + U\frac{\partial k}{\partial x} + V\frac{\partial k}{\partial y}
 + W\frac{\partial k}{\partial z} =&
\frac{\partial }{\partial x}
\left(\frac{\nu _{t} }{\sigma _{k} } \frac{\partial k}{\partial x} \right)
 + \frac{\partial }{\partial y}
\left(\frac{\nu _{t} }{\sigma _{k} } \frac{\partial k}{\partial y} \right)
 + \frac{\partial }{\partial z}
\left(\frac{\nu _{t} }{\sigma _{k} } \frac{\partial k}{\partial z} \right)
 + P -G - \varepsilon
\\
\frac{\partial \varepsilon }{\partial t}
 + U\frac{\partial \varepsilon}{\partial x}
 + V\frac{\partial \varepsilon}{\partial y}
 + W\frac{\partial \varepsilon }{\partial z}
 =& \frac{\partial }{\partial x}
\left(\frac{\nu _{t} }{\sigma _{\varepsilon } } \frac{\partial \varepsilon }{\partial x} \right )
+ \frac{\partial }{\partial y}
\left(\frac{\nu _{t} }{\sigma _{\varepsilon } } \frac{\partial \varepsilon }{\partial y} \right)
 + \frac{\partial }{\partial z}
\left(\frac{\nu _{t} }{\sigma _{\varepsilon } } \frac{\partial \varepsilon }{\partial z} \right)
\\
 &+ C_{l\varepsilon } \frac{\varepsilon }{k}
\left[P+\left(1-C_{3\varepsilon } \right)G\right]
- C_{2\varepsilon } \frac{\varepsilon^{2} }{k}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

wherein:
\begin{itemize}
\item $k=\frac{1}{2} \overline{u_{i}^{'} u_{i}^{'} }$ denotes the turbulent
kinetic energy of the fluid,

\item $u_{i}^{'} =u_{i} -\overline{u_{i} }$denotes the \textit{i}${}^{th}$ component
of the fluctuation of the velocity \textit{u},

\item $\varepsilon =\upsilon \overline{\frac{\partial u_{i}^{'} }{\partial
x_{j} } \frac{\partial u_{i}^{'} }{\partial x_{j} } }$ is the dissipation of
turbulent kinetic energy,

\item \textit{P} is a turbulent energy production term,

\item \textit{G} is a source term due to the gravitational forces,
%TODO: See how to separate the two equations but on a same line
\begin{align}
P=\nu _{t} \left(\frac{\partial \overline{U_{i}
}}{\partial x_{j} } +\frac{\partial \overline{U_{j} }}{\partial x_{i} }
\right)\frac{\partial \overline{U_{i} }}{\partial x_{j} } ; G = -
\frac{\nu _{t} }{\Pr _{t} } \frac{g}{\rho } \frac{\partial \rho
}{\partial z}
\end{align}
and $\nu _{t} $ verifies the equality: $\nu _{t} =C_{\mu }
\frac{k^{2} }{\varepsilon } $,

\item $C_{\mu }$, $\Pr _{t}$, $C_{1\varepsilon }$, $C_{2\varepsilon }$,
$C_{3\varepsilon }$,  $\sigma _{k}$, $\sigma _{\varepsilon }$ are constants in
the \textit{k}-$\epsilon$ model.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equations of tracers}

the tracer can be either active (it affects hydrodynamics) or passive in
\telemac{3D}. Temperature, salinity and in some cases a sediment are active
tracers. The tracer evolution equation is formulated as:

\begin{align}
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} +U\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}
+V\frac{\partial T}{\partial y} +W\frac{\partial T}{\partial z}
=\frac{\partial }{\partial x}
\left(\nu _{T} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \right)
+\frac{\partial }{\partial y}
\left(\nu _{T} \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \right)
+\frac{\partial }{\partial z}
\left(\nu _{T} \frac{\partial T}{\partial z} \right)+Q
\end{align}

with:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{T} (tracer unit) tracer either passive or affecting the density,

\item $n_{T}$  (m${}^{2}$/s) tracer diffusion coefficients,

\item \textit{t}  (s) time,

\item \textit{x}, \textit{y}, \textit{z} (m) space components,

\item \textit{Q} (tracer(s) unit) tracer source or sink.
\end{itemize}


\section{Mesh}


\subsection{The discretization}

the \telemac{3D} mesh structure is made of prisms (possibly split in
tetrahedrons). In order to prepare that mesh of the 3D flow domain, a
two-dimensional mesh comprising triangles which covers the computational domain
(the bottom) in a plane is first constructed, as for \telemac{2D}. The second
step consists in duplicating that mesh along the vertical direction in a number
of curved surfaces known as "planes". Between two such planes, the links
between the meshed triangles make up prisms.

The computational variables are defined at each point of the three-dimensional
mesh, inclusive of bottom and surface. Thus, they are "three-dimensional
variables" except, however, for the water depth and the bottom depth which are
obviously defined only once along a vertical. Thus, they are "two-dimensional
variables". Some \telemac{3D} actions are then shared with \telemac{2D} and use the
same libraries, such as the water depth computation library. Therefore, it is
well understood that \telemac{3D} should manage a couple of mesh structures: the
first one is two-dimensional and is the same as that used by \telemac{2D}, and
the second one is three-dimensional. That implies managing two different
numberings a detailed account of which is given below.


\subsection{The two-dimensional mesh}

the two-dimensional mesh, which is made of triangles, can be prepared using a
mesh generator software compatible with the TELEMAC system (MATISSE,
BLUE KENUE, JANET\dots ).

Using a mesh generator that does not belong to the TELEMAC chain involves
converting the resulting file, through the \stbtel interface for instance, to
the serafin format, which can be read by TELEMAC as well as by the RUBENS, BLUE
KENUE or FUDAA-PREPRO post-processors. In addition, \stbtel checks such
things as the proper orientation of the local numbering of the mesh elements.

The two-dimensional mesh (included in the \telkey{GEOMETRY FILE}) consists of
NELEM2 elements and NPOIN2 vertices of elements which are known through their
\textit{X}, \textit{Y}, and\textit{ Z}${}_{f}$ co-ordinates (the BOTTOM
variable). Each element is identified by a code known as IELM2 and includes NDP
nodes (3 for a triangle with a linear interpolation). The nodes on an element
are identified by a local number ranging from 1 to NDP. The link between that
element-wise numbering (local numbering) and the mesh node numbering ranging
from 1 to NPOIN2 (global numbering) is made through the connectivity table
IKLE2. The global number of the IDPIDP local-number node in the IELEM2 element
is IKLE2 (IELEM2,IDP).


\subsection{The three-dimensional mesh}

the three-dimensional mesh, which is made of prisms, is automatically
constructed by \telemac{3D} from the previous mesh. The data in the
three-dimensional mesh of finite elements are as follows:

%TODO: Weird spaces
\begin{itemize}
\item NPOIN3: the number of points in the mesh (NPOIN3 = NPOIN2 $\times$
NPLAN),
\item NELEM3: the number of elements in the mesh,
\item NPLAN: the number of planes in the mesh,
\item X, Y, Z: NPOIN3 dimensional arrays. X and Y are obtained by merely
duplicating the above-described arrays of the two-dimensional mesh. Dimension Z
obviously depends on the mesh construction being selected (keyword \telkey{MESH
TRANSFORMATION}),
\item IKLE3: dimensional arrays (NELEM3,6). IKLE3(IELEM3,IDP) provides with the
global number of the IDP point in the IELEM3 element. IKLE3 defines a numbering
of the 3D elements and a local numbering of the points in each element, it
provides for the transition from that local numbering to the global numbering.
\end{itemize}

From these data, \telemac{3D} constructs other arrays, such as the edge point
global address array.
