\section{Conclusion}
% 
\estel is applicable as a principal tool for hydrogeologic analysis to flow and polluant processes in porous media.
% 
In this validation document, both groundwater and transport calculations have been performed in order to demonstrate that \estel is able to model 3D polluant discharge, considering different processes (convection, diffusion, dispersion, radioactive decay/filiation, delay and precipitation), in variably saturated porous media.
