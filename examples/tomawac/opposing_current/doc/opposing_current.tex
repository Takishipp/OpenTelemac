\subsection{Opposing current}
%

% - Purpose & Problem description:
%     These first two parts give reader short details about the test case,
%     the physical phenomena involved and specify how the numerical solution will be validated
%
\subsubsection{Purpose}
%
The goal of this test-case is to check the behaviour of TOMAWAC in presence of a strong opposing current. When water meets the strong adverse current, with a velocity that approaches the wave group velocity, waves are blocked. Without any option for strong current, the amplitud of waves is overestimated.

%
\subsubsection{Description of the problem}
%
We present here the simulation of the test case of Lai \cite{lai}. We present two different options that prevent from overestimation.

Option 1 : consider an equilibrium range spectrum (in the presence of ambient flow) applied as an upper limit for the spectrum \cite{hedges} (Hedges et al. 1985)

Option 2 : add a dissipative term on the right-hand side of the action balance equation \cite{Westhuysen_2012}

For more details on formulations, one can refer to Tomawac documentation, paragraphs 4.2.3.8.1 and 4.2.3.8.2.

\subsubsection{Reference}
%
The flume experiment of Lai et al  \cite{lai} investigates the transformation of the wave spectrum on a strong negative current gradient in a flume of 8m length and 0.75m depth. An opposing current flow is induced along the flume according to figure (courant.png)

% - Physical parameters:
%     This part specifies the geometry, details all the physical parameters
%     used to describe both porous media (soil model in particularly) and
%     solute characteristics (dispersion/diffusion coefficients, soil <=> pollutant interactions...)
%
%
\subsubsection{Physical parameters}
 Concerning the modelisation of the opposing current with the first option the Phillipsâ€™s constant in the Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum is equal to 0.0081.
For the second option of this modelisation, the dissipation coefficient is equal to 0.65, and saturation threshold value is taken to 1.75 10-3.

The white-capping dissipation is the model of Westhuysen 2008. Non linear transferts between frequencies are calculated by the DIA method.

% - Geometry and Mesh:
%     This part describes the mesh used in the computation
%

\subsubsection{Geometry and Mesh}

The bathymetry is as described on figure \ref{bathyop}

\end{figure}

The mesh is made of 1701 nodes and 3200 triangles  and is shown Figure \ref{mailop}.

% - Initial and boundary conditions:
%     This part details both initial and boundary conditions used to simulate the case
%
%
\subsubsection{Initial and Boundary Conditions}
%
For both conditions, we take a Jonswap spectrum with a 1.9 cm significant wave heigth, a pic frequency of 2.2. The angular distribution function follows a $\cos^{2s} \theta$ distribution with an angular spreading of 65 and a mean direction of 90.
% - Numerical parameters:
%     This part is used to specify the numerical parameters used
%     (adaptive time step, mass-lumping when necessary...)
%
%
\subsubsection{Numerical parameters}
%
Time duration is 400s, time step is equal to 0.1s, the spectro-angular mesh has 72 angles and 36 frequences spread on a geometric progression common ratio 1.1 with a minimum of 0.25.

The option for wave growth limiter is following the Hersbach et Janssen (1999) parameterisation.

% - Results:
%     We comment in this part the numerical results against the reference ones,
%     giving understanding keys and making assumptions when necessary.
%
%
\subsubsection{Results}
%
We show the results obtained Figure \ref{reswaveblocking}.The two options are efficient to reduce the wave heigth overestimation and lead to solution closer to measurements. This shows the interest of including those options in the case of a strong opposing current.
