% - Purpose & Description:
%     These first two parts give reader short details about the test case,
%     the physical phenomena involved, the geometry and specify how the numerical solution will be validated
%
\section{Purpose}
%
This test demonstrates the ability of \telemac{3d} to model the motion
of two fluids with different densities.
%
\section{Description}
%
We consider a tank 30~m long and 1.2~m wide with a constant water depth
of 4~m.
This tank contains two fluids at rest with different densities because
of their salinity:
1~g/L in the left half part and 0~g/L on the right part.
The flow is governed by density effect.
The heavy fluid sinks below the lighter one by forming a saline wedge
which, according to the observations, make an angle of about $\pi/3$
with the bottom [2].\\
The simulation is done with and without hydrostatic hypothesis.

\section{Results}
%
Figure 3.12.3 presents the results obtained with the non-hydrostatic
version.
We can observe that the angle of $\pi/3$ between the front and the
bottom is correctly represented.\\
If we consider that the whole potential energy of the initial conditions
is transformed into kinetic energy, we can show that the front velocity
is equal to 5.5 $\alpha$ where:
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \sqrt{g \frac{\rho_2-\rho_1}{\rho_2}h^2}
\end{equation}
The respective densities are $\rho_2$ = 1000.722~kg/m$^3$
and $\rho_1$ = 999.972~kg/m$^3$.
Then the theoretical velocity of the front is equal to 0.086~m/s.
The velocity computed by \telemac{3d} is approximately 0.07~m/s
(see figure 3.12.3 where $\Delta x$ = 7~m at $t$ = 100~s).
This underestimated result was predictable because we start from a
non-established situation with zero velocity which makes the calculation
incorrect.\\
The results of the hydrostatic computation presented on figure 3.12.2
show an average velocity of approximately 0.065~m/s and an angle close
to 90$^\circ$.
This shows clearly that the hydrostatic hypothesis is not valid for
this type of computation.

densities.
