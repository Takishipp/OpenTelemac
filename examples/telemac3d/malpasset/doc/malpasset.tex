% - Purpose & Description:
%     These first two parts give reader short details about the test case,
%     the physical phenomena involved, the geometry and specify how the numerical solution will be validated
%
\section{Purpose}
%
This test illustrates that \telemac{3d} is able simulating a real dam
break flow on initially dry domain.
It also shows the propagation of the wave front and the evolution in
time of the water surface and velocities in the valley downstream.
%
\section{Description}
%
This case is the simulation of the propagation of the wave following the
break of the Malpasset dam (South-East of France).
Such accident really occurred in December 1959.
The model represents the reservoir upstream from the dam and the valley
and flood plain downstream.
The entire valley is approximately 18~km long and between 200~m (valley)
and 7~km wide (flood plain).
The complete study is described in details in [1].
The simulation is performed using 2 or 6 vertical planes ("p2" and
"p6").
An additional simulation using 2 vertical planes (named "pos") is
made using the new treatment of negative depth developed in
\telemac{3d} 7.0.
A simulation using 2 vertical planes with a large mesh (named
"p2\_large") is also performed.

\section{Results}
%
Figure 3.8.3 illustrates the progression of the flood wave after the dam
break (simulation using the treatment of negative depth that smoothes
the results on tidal flats).
The propagation of the wave front is very fast.
The water depths increase rapidly in the valley downstream from the dam
location.
The wave spreads in the plain when arriving to the sea.
During the simulation, no negative water depths are observed.
Figure 3.8.4 presents the water depth at time = 400~s obtained with 2
planes (p2), 6 planes (p6), 2 planes using the treatment of negative
depth (pos) and 2 planes using the fine mesh (p2\_large) calculations.
The results are similar.
However, the time profiles concerning the point located as indicated by
squares in the upper panels of the figure, show that the "pos"
planes simulation slightly underestimate the maximum water elevation.
%
\section{Conclusion}
%
\telemac{3d} is capable of simulating the propagation of a dam break
wave in a river valley initially dry.
